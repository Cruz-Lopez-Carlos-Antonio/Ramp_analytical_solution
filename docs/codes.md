## Overview of the Python Scripts

The repository contains seven main Python 3 scripts.  
They implement the analytical solution for $$n(t)$$ and the associated delayed neutron precursor concentration $$C(t)$$, both developed with the Modified Integration Method proposed in the submited paper. A RK4 reference solution, as well as the computational implementation of the Zhang et al. (2008) and the Palma et al. (2010) solutions.

This script implements the analytical solution of the neutron density $$n(t)$$ using **SciPy** and **NumPy**.  
The core of the implementation is based on the integral representation shown in the *Equations* page, where the involved integrals are evaluated using `scipy.integrate.quad`.

The script also contains a linear system, derived from the initial conditions $$n(0)$$ and $$\dot n(0)$$, to determine the constants $$K_1$$ and $$K_2$$ via a least-squares procedure (`numpy.linalg.lstsq`), including column-wise normalization for numerical stability.

### 2. `Neutron_density_mpmath.py`
[Link to access to the code](https://github.com/Cruz-Lopez-Carlos-Antonio/Ramp_analytical_solution/blob/main/Neutron_density_mpmath.py)
This script provides a **high-precision** version of the analytical solution for $$n(t)$$, implemented with **mpmath**.  
It includes:

- Multiprecision evaluation of the integrals $$I_1,\dots,I_6$$ described in the manuscript,
- A robust $$2\times 2$$ linear solver with row/column scaling and Tikhonov regularization,
- Control of the working precision through `mp.mp.dps`.

This implementation is used as a benchmark to assess conditioning effects and to validate the double-precision results obtained with SciPy/NumPy.

### 3. `C_precursor_SciPyNumPy.py`

This script computes the delayed neutron precursor concentration $$C(t)$$ using the convolution formula

$$
C(t)
= C(0)\,e^{-\lambda t}
+ \frac{\beta}{\Lambda}\,e^{-\lambda t}
\int_0^t e^{\lambda\tau}\,n(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

The integral is evaluated numerically using `scipy.integrate.cumulative_trapezoid`.  
The function $$n(t)$$ is imported from `Neutron_density_SciPyNumPy.py`, and the script returns a vectorized approximation of $$C(t)$$ over a prescribed time grid.

### 4. `RK4_reference_mpmath.py`

This script implements a **fourth–order Runge–Kutta (RK4)** solver in 32-digit precision (via mpmath) for the NPKE system.  

It solves simultaneously for \(n(t)\) and \(C(t)\) using a fine time step, and the resulting numerical solution is used as a high-accuracy reference to validate the analytical formulations and their numerical implementation.

Parameters, time step, and integration interval can be adjusted to reproduce the tables and figures reported in the manuscript.
