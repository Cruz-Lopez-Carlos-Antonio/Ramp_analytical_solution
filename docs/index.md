## Overview

This site documents a new analytical solution for the Neutron Point Kinetics Equations (NPKE) with a linear ramp reactivity of the form

$$
\rho(t) = a t + b.
$$

The corresponding Python 3 codes implement:

- An analytical representation of the neutron density \(n(t)\),
- The delayed neutron precursor concentration \(C(t)\),
- And a high-precision Runge–Kutta 4 (RK4) reference solver.

These results accompany the manuscript  
***Analytical solutions of the Neutron Point Kinetics Equations under a linear reactivity ramp***,  
submitted to the journal *Computer Physics Communications*.
